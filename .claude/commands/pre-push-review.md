## Instructions

Review all unpushed commits for issues that should not be made public.
Report any findings and recommend whether it is safe to push.

## Diff to review

!`git log --oneline origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD 2>/dev/null && echo "---DIFF---" && git diff origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD 2>/dev/null || (echo "No remote tracking branch. Showing all commits on this branch:" && git log --oneline main..HEAD && echo "---DIFF---" && git diff main..HEAD)`

## Checklist

Review the diff above for each of the following:

### 1. Secrets and credentials

- API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys
- `.env` file contents or environment variable values
- OAuth client secrets, webhook URLs with tokens
- Base64-encoded credentials

### 2. License compliance

- Copied code from other projects without proper attribution
- LICENSE or NOTICE files removed or altered inappropriately
- Code snippets from Stack Overflow or blogs without license compatibility

### 3. Personal or environment-specific information

- OS usernames, home directory paths (e.g. `/Users/username/`, `/home/username/`)
- Machine hostnames, local IP addresses
- Hardcoded absolute paths that only work on one machine
- Email addresses or real names in places other than git author metadata

### 4. Sensitive configuration

- Database connection strings with real hosts or credentials
- Internal URLs, staging/production endpoints
- Debug flags or development-only settings that should not ship

### 5. Unintended file inclusions

- Binary files, build artifacts, or cache files
- Large generated files (e.g. `lazy-lock.json` changes that are noise)
- Files that should be in `.gitignore`

## Output format

For each category, report one of:

- **OK** — no issues found
- **WARNING** — potential issue (describe what and where)
- **BLOCK** — must fix before pushing (describe what and where)

End with a summary: **Safe to push** or **Do not push** with reasons.
