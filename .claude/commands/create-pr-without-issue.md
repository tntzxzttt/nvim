## Instructions

Commit the current working-tree changes and create a PR **without** a linked issue.
Always ask the user for approval before committing and before creating the PR.

## Pre-flight

Current status:

!`git status`

Current diff (staged + unstaged):

!`git diff HEAD`

If there are no changes to commit, tell the user and stop.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the branch

Run these commands **in order**. If any step fails, stop and report the error.

```
git stash
git switch main
git pull
```

Then create a feature branch. Derive the branch name from the changes using the
CLAUDE.md branch naming rules (`<type>/<title>`, lowercase, `[a-z0-9/-]` only).

```
git switch -c <branch>
git stash pop
```

**If `git stash pop` produces a conflict, stop immediately.** Tell the user
there is a merge conflict and do not proceed further.

### 2. Commit

Review the changes and split them into commits at an appropriate granularity.
Follow the Conventional Commits format defined in CLAUDE.md.
Since there is no linked issue, omit the `(#N)` suffix.
Since the commit-msg hook requires interactive confirmation for missing scope/issue,
use `-n` (`--no-verify`) when either is absent.

**Before running each `git commit`, show the user the files to be staged and the
proposed commit message, then ask for approval.**

### 3. Push & create PR

Push the branch and create a PR using `gh pr create`.

- Title: sentence case (first word capitalized only)
- Body: follow the PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
  (read the template first; use the "not linked to an issue" variant)

**Before creating the PR, show the user the proposed title and body, then ask
for approval.**

Return the PR URL when done.
